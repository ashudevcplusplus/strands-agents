Strands Agents (Local)

This is a minimal local package for experimenting with Strands Agents examples.

Setup
- Create a virtual environment (Python 3.10+)
- Install the package in editable mode: `pip install -e .`
- Run: `python -m strands_agents` (prints a hello message)

Examples
The examples in `examples/python/` depend on external packages like `strands`,
`strands_tools`, `mcp`, and may require an Ollama server. Install those from
PyPI and run Ollama locally if you want to try them.
